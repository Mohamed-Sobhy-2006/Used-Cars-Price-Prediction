# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars using machine learning.  
The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate fair car prices based on key features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission type.  

The workflow includes:
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Log transformation of the target variable (price) to handle skewness
- Feature preprocessing and encoding
- Regression modeling with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Saving the trained model as a `.pkl` file for future use

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive visualization)
- Pickle (for model saving)

## 📊 Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on car dataset  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Regression models for price prediction  
- Model evaluation using R² and RMSE  
- Exporting the trained ML model as a pickle file
